Using the で Particle to Mark Cause or Reason

Earlier today, I was watching a [GameGengo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlvQCc6Nvm0) focused on the Genki I textbook. I’ve decided to take another look at grammar since it’s my weakest point, though I feel confident about the first few grammar points. While watching the section on で, I went back through my Anki cards to check whether they all still made sense.

I was familiar with the two uses of で explained in the video:

Place of action
学校で勉強する — study at school

Tool / means (the thing used to carry out the action)

少年は網でその蝶を捕まえた。
The boy caught the butterfly with a net.

So far, so good.

Then I ran into the following Anki card:

台風で木が倒れた。
“A tree fell because of a typhoon.”

A typhoon is neither a place nor a tool, so why で?

After some Googling, I found an explanation: で can mark the circumstance or cause under which something happens. This usage usually applies to events, natural causes, or unavoidable situations.

And then I found another example in my Anki cards:

釘を踏んで怪我をしました。
“I injured myself by stepping on a nail.”
