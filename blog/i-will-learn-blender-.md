I Will Learn Blender 💪🏻

Now and again I get interested in learning to use 3D software. One of the main reasons I'm looking into 3D software is because lately I just haven't been enjoying illustration as much, and I feel stuck with my current style. Drawing has never really been my thing naturally - most of my illustrations are actually just me piecing things together in Illustrator until they work. My process has always been more about methodically constructing images than drawing freehand. I spend hours tweaking and adjusting elements until they look right, building up an image out of separate elements. And honestly, I enjoy that 'building' process way more than traditional drawing.

What I'm wondering is if the constructive nature of 3D modeling might align better with how I naturally approach visual creation, potentially offering me a new path forward.

Because I've tried Blender a few times before and then dropped it, I've decided to commit to spending at least a thousand hours learning Blender. This time I want to get past the 'tutorial' phase and actually start making some 3D illustrations.
However, I will have to start with that basic cube and figuring out how the hell it even moves around in the 3D space.
