Fried Eggs and Japanese Super Immersion

Two great things happened to me today:

1. I learned the Japanese word for 'fried eggs,' which I surprisingly never came across nor ever used in Japan, even though I love eating them. Maybe it's due to my heavy addiction to convenience store tamago-sando, which uses chopped up boiled eggs mixed with mayonnaise.

2. Fried eggs are what Toriyama-san had for breakfast this morning. That in itself is not great for me per se; however, it comes from a video created by the guys behind a channel called [Japanese Super Immersion](https://www.youtube.com/@JSI55), which was recommended to me this morning and I have been really enjoying.

#### Finding Entertaining and Beginner-friendly Content

I've had a hard time finding beginner level Japanese immersion content which is educational yet entertaining to watch. I easily get bored by the generic topics discussed on most language learning channels and when I find content that aligns with my interests its usually to difficult for me to enjoy.

What makes the conversations between Toriyama-san and Miyazaki-san entertaining to watch for me is that they are similar to my own friends, not taking themselves too seriously and joking while having a conversation. I feel like I could easily hang out with them in real life, which also makes me genuinely interested in what they have to say, and that seems to be the part I was missing so far with other channels.
