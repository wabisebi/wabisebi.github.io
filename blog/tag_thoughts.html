It Doesn&rsquo;t Count if You Don&rsquo;t Share it

<p>In my previous post, I talked about the bad habit of not finishing projects and always jumping to a next, more novel one. A frustrating side-effect of this is that we will sometimes see another person executing a very similar idea, sharing it online and receiving positive feedback. In my case, these are usually illustrations or art projects which are very close to something I have been working on for a long time.</p>

<p>I recently came across two passages that have helped me realize that I have only myself to blame for feeling upset when this happens.</p>

<p>In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a> music producer Rick Rubin shares a beautiful way of thinking about ideas, almost like independent entities floating around in the universe that want to be found. It&rsquo;s flipping the narrative, making ideas the important thing and our personal struggles or ego secondary.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you have an idea you&rsquo;re excited about and you don&rsquo;t bring it to life, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for the idea to find its voice through another maker. This isn&rsquo;t because the other artist stole your idea, but because the idea&rsquo;s time has come.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Author and marketer <a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a> states it less poetically and cuts straight to the point when explaining the importance of <em>shipping</em> your idea or product out into the world in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53479927-the-practice?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=KNybrLUG3u&amp;rank=1">The Practice: Shipping Creative Work</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shipping, because it doesn&rsquo;t count if you don&rsquo;t share it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not to say that we can&rsquo;t make things purely for ourselves, which definitely counts in its own way. But if we want feedback and a relationship with others through our work, it will only happen if we actually put it out there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try and share things in a state where they might not yet feel &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; (whatever that means), rather than waiting too long and losing interest or missing the moment. It might not ever be a masterpiece, but at least it now counts.
