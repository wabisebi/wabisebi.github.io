I Made My First YouTube Video

During my last visit to Japan in June, I started my first small video project: creating a fully edited and color-graded travel video. And [against all expectations](./sharing-counts.html), I actually finished it. I ended up buying a DJI Osmo Pocket 3—a cute little film camera with a built-in stabilizer—along with some ND filters to help shoot in bright daylight. Over the course of two weeks, I captured scenes during my long walks through Tokyo.

After a ton of YouTube tutorials on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, I made this little video.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-top: 2rem;">
    <iframe 
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vi9HIfsZ5aA" 
        title="YouTube video player" 
        frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>
