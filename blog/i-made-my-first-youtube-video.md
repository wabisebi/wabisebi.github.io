I Made My First YouTube Video

Whether it's figuring out how to fix a broken faucet, learning code, or watching [let's play videos in Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DHOVziRwBA), YouTube is the place where I consume most of my daily content.

I've been curious about the process of making a video from start to finish but never had an compelling idea to make a video for.

During my last visit to Japan in June, I decided to do a little filming project, making a fully edited and color-graded travel video, and [against all expectations](./sharing-counts.html), I actually finished it. I ended up buying a DJI Osmo Pocket 3, a cute little film camera with built-in stabilizer, together with some ND filters that help shoot in bright daylight. Over the course of two weeks, I shot scenes during my long walks through Tokyo.

I decided on the editing software DaVinci Resolve, watched a ton of YouTube videos on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, and made this little video.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-top: 2rem;">
    <iframe 
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vi9HIfsZ5aA" 
        title="YouTube video player" 
        frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>
