I Made My First YouTube Video

During my visit to Japan last June, I worked on my first little film project, creating a fully edited and color-graded travel video. I used a DJI Osmo Pocket 3—a cute little film camera with a built-in stabilizer—along with some ND filters to help shoot in bright daylight. Over the course of two weeks, I captured scenes during my long walks through Tokyo.

After a ton of YouTube tutorials on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, this is the final result. The music is by one of my favorite Japanese musicians, Tomoyuki Asakawa.
