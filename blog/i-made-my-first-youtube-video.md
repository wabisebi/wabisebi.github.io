I Made My First YouTube Video

Last June I worked on my first video project while visiting Tokyo. I used a DJI Osmo Pocket 3â€”a small, cute-looking film camera which stabilizes itself during filming. Over the course of two weeks, I captured scenes during my walks through the vast metropolis of Tokyo as well as some lovely day trips with my partner.

After a ton of YouTube tutorials on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, this is the final result. The music is by one of my favorite Japanese musicians, Tomoyuki Asakawa and proved very helpful for making selection of shots.
