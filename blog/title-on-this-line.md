Blogging like it's 2001

In 2001, I learned to code my first websiteâ€”a site all about Spider-Man comics, something I was into collecting at the time. It was built in HTML, using iframes and everything. Then came a Harry Potter fan site with a custom cursor in the shape of a wand, followed a year later by a website celebrating the then newly launched Xbox. These were somewhat early days of the internet, and I just registered xbox.net. I received an email from Microsoft at the time, giving me access to the latest news about Xbox, hoping my site would grow. They didn't realize I was only twelve at the time.

All these website projects were abandoned as quickly as they were conceived. Once the novelty wore off, I jumped to the next thing. This pattern would follow me for many years to come.

Two years ago, I started working on a website called Wabisebi. It started out as a simple idea to blog about my interest in Japan...
