It Doesn&rsquo;t Count if You Don&rsquo;t Share it

<p>In my previous post, I talked about the bad habit of not seeing projects through and always jumping to a next, more novel one. A frustrating side-effect of this is that we will often see someone else executing a very similar idea, sharing it online and receiving positive feedback. In my case, these are usually illustrations or art projects which are very close to something I have been working on for a long time.</p>

<p>I recently came across two passages that have helped me realize that I have only myself to blame for feeling upset when this happens.</p>

<p>In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a> music producer Rick Rubin shares a beautiful way of thinking about ideas, almost like independent entities floating around in the universe that want to be found and shared with others. It&rsquo;s flipping the narrative, making ideas the important thing and our personal struggles or ego secondary.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you have an idea you&rsquo;re excited about and you don&rsquo;t bring it to life, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for the idea to find its voice through another maker. This isn&rsquo;t because the other artist stole your idea, but because the idea&rsquo;s time has come.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Author and marketer <a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a> states it less poetically and cuts straight to the point when explaining the importance of <em>shipping</em> your idea or product out into the world in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53479927-the-practice?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=KNybrLUG3u&amp;rank=1">The Practice: Shipping Creative Work</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shipping, because it doesn&rsquo;t count if you don&rsquo;t share it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not to say that we can&rsquo;t make things purely out of joy for ourselves, which definitely counts in its own way. But if we want feedback and a relationship with others through our work, it will only happen if we actually put it out there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try and share things in a state where they might not yet feel &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; (whatever that means), rather than waiting too long and losing interest or missing the moment. It might not ever be a masterpiece, but at least it now counts.

<p>In 2001, I coded my first website, all about Spider-Man comics. I built it in HTML, complete with iframes and speech bubble drawings for the navigation. More sites followed: a Harry Potter fan site and a site celebrating the newly-launched Xbox to name a few.</p>

<p>Each project was abandoned as quickly as it was conceived. Once the novelty wore off, I&rsquo;d jump to the next thing, leaving behind a wasteland of iframes and half-written introductions.</p>

<p>This pattern of jumping from project to project has followed me throughout my life.</p>

<p>Two years ago, I started working on <em>Wabisebi</em>, a blog about Japan. Soon came additional ideas: book reviews, artist spotlights, and a language study section. I hired developers, kept adding features, and talked up this great project I was building. But like always, the novelty wore off and perfectionism kicked in. The thought of filling and illustrating the entire blog became overwhelming.</p>

<p>Recently I spent a lot of time reflecting on this recurring problem and decided to try out a change. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good to do the <em>reverse</em> of what has not been working.</p>

<p>So, instead of building a website with tons of features that I then need to fill up, I&rsquo;ve decided to start bottom-up. Starting at its most basic fundamentals and only implementing things when they are <em>really</em> needed. I&rsquo;m using this simple <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashlog script</a>, which converts markdown text into HTML pages and let&rsquo;s me post straight from the command line. Sometimes the best way forward is to strip everything back to its essentials and just begin.</p>
