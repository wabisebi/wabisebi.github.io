<p>Today marks exactly two years since I started studying Japanese, and although I have made considerable progress, I&rsquo;m feeling somewhat disappointed with my current level. I&rsquo;ve spent some time reflecting on where I think this feeling comes from.</p>

<h4>The Japanese Self-Study Community – A Double-Edged Sword</h4>

<p>For the past two years, I have been self-studying Japanese. I prefer learning skills at my own pace rather than joining traditional classes; however, I do find it motivating to hear about other people&rsquo;s experiences and to adjust my own systems when I come across good advice. YouTube is where I spend most of my time finding that kind of advice. In fact, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Livakivi">Livakivi&rsquo;s</a> video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpfCWogjnwc&amp;t=788s">I Learned Japanese 1 Hour a Day for 600 Days Straight</a> that motivated me to set study goals and provided me with a sort of blueprint. Most of my process up until now has been based on Livakivi&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p>While the Japanese language learning community on YouTube provides me with inspiring content, it&rsquo;s also marked by heated debates about learning methods. Some of its prominent content creators project unwavering confidence, competing to showcase perfect pitch accent while boasting about their relatively rapid path to fluency. The core message: achieve Japanese fluency quickly through intensive immersion—an idea popularized by the <a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AJATT method</a>. Some advocate living entirely in Japanese (AJATT stands for All Japanese All The Time), abandoning your English-speaking friends and sleeping with Japanese audio playing in the background, a pseudoscience coined &lsquo;passive immersion&rsquo;. They dismiss other approaches as wasteful, including traditional textbooks, with one popular creator claiming that studying less than two hours daily means you should quit altogether.</p>

<p>The problem is that someone who has become very skilled at something is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students about that thing, and while mastery can build self-confidence, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations when teaching others or develop into a downright arrogant attitude. Some of this might have to do with the cognitive bias called &ldquo;the expert blind spot,&rdquo; which occurs when someone who has mastered a skill loses sight of what it&rsquo;s like to be a beginner, or maybe it&rsquo;s just the fact that some content creators also have a &lsquo;unique&rsquo; course to sell you.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, a recurring part of the narrative seems to be this &ldquo;no pain, no gain&rdquo; rhetoric which is so pervasive online nowadays. People often showcase their intense dedication and long hours as the only path to success, implying that those who can&rsquo;t match this intensity somehow lack commitment. This overlooks the reality that people live different lives with varying circumstances, and the time someone can devote to learning doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect their passion or desire to improve.</p>

<p>And that gets to the heart of my issue this morning—not my progress, but the comparison to others is what is making me feel unhappy. It&rsquo;s learning 4,000 vocabulary words in two years and then seeing someone on Reddit who claims they learned 1,700 in just two weeks. Comparing ourselves to others is the quickest way to suck the joy out of anything we&rsquo;re doing. That&rsquo;s precisely why I spend very little time on social media these days. Even though I&rsquo;m well aware of the pitfalls of comparison, I still let it get to me when it comes to language learning.</p>

<p>And so, I want to end on a positive note as well as a reminder to myself: What matters most is that I&rsquo;ve improved consistently over these past two years, studying daily without giving up and building a consistent habit. I may not have aced the N1 proficiency test in eight months or shocked any natives with my perfect Japanese accent, but I&rsquo;m advancing at my own pace and enjoying the moments when I am able to do new things.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9n66Aap13o">Matsuoka Shuzo</a>, Japan&rsquo;s most positive man, would say: 諦めんなよ！Never give up!</p>

Fried Eggs and Japanese Super Immersion

<p>Two great things happened to me today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I learned the Japanese word for &lsquo;fried eggs,&rsquo; which I surprisingly never came across nor ever used in Japan, even though I love eating them. Maybe it&rsquo;s due to my heavy addiction to convenience store bought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RelaC9GBwMs">tamago-sando</a>, which uses chopped up boiled eggs mixed with mayonnaise.</p></li>
<li><p>Fried eggs are what Toriyama-san had for breakfast this morning. That in itself is not great for me per se; however, it comes from a video created by the guys behind a channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JSI55">Japanese Super Immersion</a>, which was recommended to me this morning and I have been really enjoying.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Finding Entertaining and Beginner-friendly Content</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a hard time finding beginner level Japanese immersion content which is educational yet entertaining to watch. I easily get bored by the generic topics discussed on most language learning channels and when I find content that aligns with my interests its usually to difficult for me to enjoy.</p>

<p>What makes the conversations between Toriyama-san and Miyazaki-san entertaining to watch for me is that they are similar to my own friends, not taking themselves too seriously and joking while having a conversation. I feel like I could easily hang out with them in real life, which also makes me genuinely interested in what they have to say, and that seems to be the part I was missing so far with other channels.</p>

<p>Last June I worked on my first video project while visiting Tokyo. I used a DJI Osmo Pocket 3—a small, cute-looking film camera which stabilizes itself during filming. Over the course of two weeks, I captured scenes during my walks through the vast metropolis of Tokyo as well as some lovely day trips with my partner.</p>

<p>After a ton of YouTube tutorials on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, this is the final result. The music is by one of my favorite Japanese musicians, Tomoyuki Asakawa and proved very helpful for making selection of shots.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="how-i-learned-the-kana.html">
How I Learned Hiragana and Katakana
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202501271710.20# -->
<div class="subtitle">January 27, 2025 &mdash;

<p>The Japanese written language is a fusion of three distinct scripts. Children in Japan first learn Hiragana and Katakana, before progressing to the more complex and vast set of Kanji characters, which were imported from China around the 5th century CE.</p>

<h4>Phonetics</h4>

<p>Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic scripts, meaning they visually represent sounds used in speech and don&rsquo;t carry any meaning. Both character sets share the same syllables but serve different purposes within the language. Although not used this way in practice, you could technically spell all Japanese words using just these two scripts.</p>

<h4>Memorizing Characters Using Mnemonics</h4>

<p>I found memorizing Hiragana and Katakana fairly easy, and it took me about a week. What worked best was utilizing <strong>visual mnemonics</strong> that simplify remembering information through simple associations.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for memorizing the character &lsquo;の.&rsquo; This character represents a syllable roughly pronounced as &lsquo;no&rsquo; in the English word &lsquo;not&rsquo;. Associating it with a &lsquo;No/not smoking&rsquo; sign, which is similar in shape to the hiragana character, was a helpful visual cue.</p>

<p><img src="./img/ws_kana_no_smoking.webp" alt="kana-no-sign" /></p>

<p>The internet is full of examples of mnemonics for the kana, so there is no need to make them up yourself.</p>

<h4>Learning How to Write</h4>

<p>Learning to write Hiragana and Katakana isn&rsquo;t too challenging, but it&rsquo;s important to follow the correct stroke order. Correct stroke order is crucial because it helps you intuitively write new characters and improves readability.</p>

<p>I started with some practice sheets to learn the stroke order, and then switched to a gridded notebook, writing the characters from memory.</p>

<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>

<p>During my first month in Japan back in 2020, I regularly did speed quizzes to recognize kana as quickly as possible. Pretty soon, the characters came naturally, and eventually, I didn&rsquo;t have to rely on mnemonics. Reading Hiragana and Katakana now feels as familiar as reading the Latin script; I simply know their shapes and sounds without having to think about them.</p>

<h4>Practical Use in Daily Life</h4>

<p>Hiragana is mostly used for Japanese-origin words, so without knowing the meanings of those words, it wasn&rsquo;t very useful to me until I started learning some actual vocabulary.</p>

<p>The most useful thing for me right from the start was knowing Katakana. This script is primarily used for foreign loanwords, often imported from English, making them easy to understand. For instance, when I was searching for shampoo at a convenience store, I picked up a bottle with the text &lsquo;シャンプー&rsquo; on it. These syllables spell &lsquo;sha-n-puu,&rsquo; making it likely I had found the right product. Although only a small step, it started making things easier for me and marked my beginning of learning Japanese vocabulary.</p>

It Doesn&rsquo;t Count if You Don&rsquo;t Share it

<p>In my previous post, I talked about my bad habit of not finishing self-initiated projects. A frustrating side-effect of this is that I will inevitably see another person executing a very similar idea, sharing it publicly and receiving positive feedback. Now it feels like I&rsquo;ve missed my window and ever launching it would seem derivative. These are usually illustrations or art projects which are very close to something I have been working on for a long time but never felt like it was ready to share.</p>

<p>I recently came across a passage that helped me realize that I have only myself to blame for feeling upset when this happens.</p>

<p>In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a>, music producer Rick Rubin shares what I find to be a beautiful perspective on <em>ideas</em>. I think of his view as seeing ideas almost like independent entities floating in the universe, waiting to be found and brought to life.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you have an idea you&rsquo;re excited about and you don&rsquo;t bring it to life, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for the idea to find its voice through another maker. This isn&rsquo;t because the other artist stole your idea, but because the idea&rsquo;s time has come.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Author and marketer <a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a> states it less poetically in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53479927-the-practice?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=KNybrLUG3u&amp;rank=1">The Practice: Shipping Creative Work</a> and cuts straight to the point when explaining the importance of <em>shipping</em> your idea or product out into the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shipping, because it doesn&rsquo;t count if you don&rsquo;t share it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not to say that we can&rsquo;t make things purely for ourselves, which definitely counts in its own way. But if we want feedback and a relationship with others through our work, it will only happen if we actually put it out there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try and share things in a state where they might not yet feel &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; (whatever that means), rather than waiting too long and losing the moment. It might not ever be a masterpiece, but at least it now counts.

<p>In 2001, I coded my first website, all about Spider-Man comics. I built it in HTML, complete with iframes and speech bubble drawings for the navigation. More sites followed: a Harry Potter fan site and a site celebrating the newly-launched Xbox to name a few.</p>

<p>Each project was abandoned as quickly as it was conceived. Once the novelty wore off, I&rsquo;d jump to the next thing, leaving behind a wasteland of iframes and half-written introductions.</p>

<p>This pattern of jumping from project to project has followed me throughout my life.</p>

<p>Two years ago, I started working on <em>Wabisebi</em>, a blog about Japan. Soon came additional ideas: book reviews, artist spotlights, and a language study section. I hired developers, kept adding features, and talked up this great project I was building. But like always, the novelty wore off and perfectionism kicked in. The thought of filling and illustrating the entire blog became overwhelming.</p>

<p>Recently I spent a lot of time reflecting on this recurring problem and decided to try out a change. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good to do the <em>reverse</em> of what has not been working.</p>

<p>So, instead of building a website with tons of features that I then need to fill up, I&rsquo;ve decided to start bottom-up. Starting at its most basic fundamentals and only implementing things when they are <em>really</em> needed. I&rsquo;m using this simple <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashlog script</a>, which converts markdown text into HTML pages and let&rsquo;s me post straight from the command line. Sometimes the best way forward is to strip everything back to its essentials and just begin.</p>
