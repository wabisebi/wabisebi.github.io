Sentence Mining Within the Core 6K Deck

I’ve worked through about two-thirds of the [Core 6k Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1880390099) so far. At some point, I got bored with it and shifted to sentence mining—mainly picking out new words from content I actually enjoy, like shows, articles, or YouTube videos.

But every now and then, especially while reading the [NHK Easy website](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/), I come across words that turn out to be from the unseen part of the Core 6k deck. Even though I haven’t officially studied those cards yet, I end up mining them naturally through immersion.

It’s a good reminder that sentence mining isn’t just for completely new words outside the deck. It can also overlap with words I would have eventually reached in Core6k—just in a way that feels much more alive and relevant.
