The Wild Web of Language Learning Gurus

Today marks exactly two years since I started studying Japanese, and although I have made considerable progress, I'm feeling somewhat disappointed this morning at my current level. I've spent some time reflecting on where I think this feeling comes from and how to feel more positive.

#### The Japanese Self-Study Community – A Double-Edged Sword

For the past two years, I have been self-studying Japanese. I prefer learning skills at my own pace rather than joining traditional classes; however, I do find it motivating to hear about other people's experiences and to adjust my own systems when I come across good advice. YouTube is where I spend most of my time finding that kind of advice. In fact, it was Livakivi's video [I Learned Japanese 1 Hour a Day for 600 Days Straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpfCWogjnwc&t=788s) that motivated me to set some real study goals and provided me with a sort of blueprint for the foreseeable future. Most of my process up until now has been based on Livakivi's journey. It's been very helpful to see someone who is a few years ahead of me, seeing their process and results and replicating them.

So, while the Japanese language learning community on YouTube provides me with inspiring content, it's also marked by heated debates about learning methods and the occasional drama between community figures. Some of its prominent content creators project unwavering confidence, competing to showcase perfect pitch accent while boasting about their relatively rapid path to fluency. The core message: achieve Japanese fluency quickly through intensive immersion—an idea popularized by the [AJATT method](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Some advocate living entirely in Japanese (AJATT stands for All Japanese All The Time), abandoning your English-speaking friends and sleeping with Japanese audio playing in the background, a pseudoscience coined 'passive immersion'. They dismiss other approaches as wasteful, including traditional textbooks, with one popular creator claiming that studying less than two hours daily means you should quit altogether. Add claims about permanent damage from learning concepts in the "wrong order," and newcomers are left confused and anxious about where to begin.

The problem is that someone who has become very skilled at something is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students about that thing, and while mastery can build self-confidence, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations when teaching others or develop into a downright arrogant attitude. Some of this might have to do with the cognitive bias called ["the expert blind spot,"](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/sites/default/files/attached-files/00-05.pdf) which occurs when someone who has mastered a skill loses sight of what it's like to be a beginner, or maybe it's just the fact that some content creators also have a 'unique' course to sell you.

Whatever the reason, a recurring part of the narrative seems to be this "no pain, no gain" rhetoric which is so pervasive online nowadays. Bragging about the amount of hours and dedication put into something and making others feel bad if they don't have the power to do the same, like it has something to do with their willingness to learn something and not with the fact that people live different lives and the amount of time someone spends doesn't correlate to how much they want something.

And that gets to the heart of my issue this morning—not my progress, but the comparison to others is what is making me feel unhappy. It's learning 4,000 vocabulary words in two years and then seeing someone on Reddit who learned 1,700 in two weeks. Comparison is the quickest way to suck the joy out of anything. It's the reason I spend barely any time on social media. Even though I know this, it caught me off guard when researching Japanese learning. 

And so, to end on a positive note and as a reminder to myself: What matters most is that I've improved consistently over these past two years, studying daily without giving up, building a consistent habit. I may not have aced the N1 proficiency test in eight months or shocked any natives with my perfect Japanese accent, but I'm advancing at my own pace, enjoying the moments when I am able to do new things.
