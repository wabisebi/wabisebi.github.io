Feeling Dissapointed and The Wild Web of Language Learning Gurus

It's been exactly two years since I started studying Japanese. This two-year mark is giving me mixed feelings this morning. While people around me tell me they admire the daily discipline I put into my studies, I constantly feel I could have done a lot more. I spent some time reflecting on why I feel this way even though objectively I have made considerable progress.

#### The Japanese Self-Study Community â€“ A Double-Edged Sword

The Japanese self-study community on YouTube and Reddit is a peculiar one. Sometimes inspiring, such as when Livakivi uploads a new video on Japanese studies, it's also marked by heated debates about the most efficient language learning methods and the occasional personal dramas. Some of its most prominent content creators are twenty-somethings who project unwavering confidence in their approaches, competing to showcase their perfect pitch accent while also boasting about how quickly they achieved fluency.

The core message seems somewhat universal: If you really want to become fluent in Japanese, you can do it in an extremely short time span by just immersing for a large number of hours each day, an idea popularized by the [AJATT method](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Some go as far as saying you should live 24/7 in Japanese, disregarding your social life. Do anything else and it's a waste of time. (One popular creator even stating that if you can't do two hours a day you should just quit Japanese altogether.) Throw in the dubious claim that learning in the wrong order will permanently harm your fluency, and you have a recipe to make new learners confused and worried about where to start. Sure, some of these creators also offer expensive 'unique' learning methods and have personal gain by but there is something that bothers me more.

#### The Problem with Fluency as The End Goal

What I rarely hear these creators talk about are building meaningful connections through language or learning more about another culture. It seems the focus is on being good in Japanese

 George Trombley, the well-known creator of the [Japanese From Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsrakMT1h2g&list=PLOcym2c7xnBy_L5_iQzgSrzMIXH7DUwB0&index=3) series has sometimes gotten flak for having to look up kanji, or not having read a lot of novels in Japanese as being somewhat not qualified enough. However, there are a lot of videos of George having fun with Japanese locals and friends, whereas the pitch-perfect millennials keep talking about Japanese from their bedrooms and seem somewhat anti-social or unlikable. Let's say I know who I'd rather hang out with. 
 
 The problem here is that someone who is very good at Japanese is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students. 

I'm usually pretty good at putting things into perspective. How I choose to spend my time is very different from when I was in my 20s, and even though I could technically make more time, priorities of how I want to spend my time have shifted over the years. However, these all-or-nothing videos did get to me. Whatever progress I make, I feel like it's extremely slow compared to other people.

Long story short, what's bothering me is not my own progress, but the comparison to others. Comparassion is the quickest way to suck the joy out of any activity and it's why I'm rarely on social media. 

 And so, I'll end on a positive note with and as the great Matsuoka Shuzo tells you 'dont give up keep going'
