Japanese with Tanaka-san and Creating New Flashcards for Familiar Vocabulary

I've been sentence mining some new vocabulary words today from the beginner-friendly YouTube channel [Learn Japanese with Tanaka san](https://www.youtube.com/@japanese_tanakasan) and wanted to share it here as I think it's a good channel. Right now I have about 80-90% word comprehension on most videos, which works well since I understand most of what is being said but am still picking up some new, high-frequency words.

What I've found useful is that I'm also encountering words I already know from my Anki deck, but seeing them used in natural contexts and different sentence patterns. It's been helpful for reinforcing my understanding and picking up more nuanced usage that I might have missed when just learning the isolated vocabulary. It's one thing to know a word's definition, but seeing how it actually works in conversation makes a difference.

I've been creating new flashcards for these already known words with the sentences from the videos, and now I'm wondering if I should delete the original cards from my core 6k deck since the new context-based ones seem more useful.
