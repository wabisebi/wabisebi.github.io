My Thoughts after Finishing Wanikani's 3 Level Trial

Today, I finished the third and final free level of WaniKani’s trial and I thought it would be nice to write about it. Just to make it clear, this post is not sponsored in any way or shape.

I’ve known about WaniKani since I started learning Japanese about 2.5 years ago. I first picked up Hiragana and Katakana—the two basic writing systems—using mnemonics from Tofugu, the same team behind WaniKani. So it was always something I was aware of, even if I didn’t use it right away.

Now that I’ve finally given the trial a proper try, I wanted to share my thoughts. But before getting into that, I think it helps to explain the path I took to get here—since it shaped how I experienced WaniKani.

#### Why I Didn’t Use WaniKani Earlier
When I first looked into WaniKani, I saw a lot of people say it was too slow and that you could learn kanji more effectively using immersion or a free flashcard app like Anki. Since those options were free and more flexible, I decided to go with them instead.

At that point, I chose to start with Remembering the Kanji (RTK) by James Heisig. The idea is to learn a single general meaning for each kanji and reinforce it by writing it out by hand.

I went through about 2,200 kanji with RTK, which gave me a basic sense of what they looked like and roughly what they meant. But there were clear downsides: it doesn’t teach you how to read or pronounce anything, and handwriting every kanji is time-consuming. Over time, I forgot many of the meanings, especially for kanji I didn’t see again elsewhere.

#### Shifting Focus to Vocabulary
After RTK, I switched to the well-known Anki Core 2k/6k deck. It teaches common Japanese vocabulary with audio, example sentences, and natural context—everything RTK lacked. I’m still using it now and I’m about two-thirds of the way through.

To date, I’ve learned 4,759 vocabulary words. I’ve focused on reading whole words, not breaking them down into individual kanji. I haven’t studied kanji readings directly, but I’ve started to pick them up just by seeing the same characters used across different words.

#### So Why WaniKani Now?

So why try WaniKani now? Mostly out of curiosity.

I’ve always wondered how it compares to the other tools I’ve used, especially now that I already know a fair amount of vocabulary. I wanted to see how WaniKani actually works in practice—and whether its structured, mnemonic-heavy style still has something to offer at this stage.
