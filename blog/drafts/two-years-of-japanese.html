<p>My day usually starts out with reviews of vocabulary flashcards in a spaced-repetition application called Anki, which also happens to display a heatmap of days studied. This morning I noticed that it&rsquo;s been exactly two years since I started studying Japanese. The two-year mark is giving me mixed feelings, with slight disappointment seeming to win the battle. I spend some time this morning reflecting on why I feel this.</p>

<h4>The Japanese Self-Study Community&ndash; a double-edged sword</h4>

<p>The Japanese self-study community on YouTube and Reddit is a peculiar one, marked by heated debates about the most efficient language learning methods. Some of its most prominent content creators are twenty-somethings who project unwavering confidence in their approaches, often competing to showcase their perfect pitch accent while boasting about how quickly they achieved fluency.</p>

<p>The core message of these &lsquo;gurus&rsquo; seems universal: If you really want to become fluent in Japanese, you can do it in an extremely short time span by just immersing for a large number of hours each day, an idea popularized by the <a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AJATT method</a>. Some go as far as saying you should live 24/7 in Japanese, disregarding your social life. Do anything else and it&rsquo;s a waste of time. (One popular creator even stating that if you can&rsquo;t do two hours a day you should just quit Japanese altogether.) Throw in the dubious claim that learning in the wrong order will permanently harm your fluency, and you have a recipe to make new learners confused and worried about where to start.</p>

<p>What I rarely hear these creators talk about are building meaningful connections through language or learning more about another culture. It seems the focus is on being good in Japanese</p>

<p> George Trombley, the well-known creator of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsrakMT1h2g&amp;list=PLOcym2c7xnBy_L5_iQzgSrzMIXH7DUwB0&amp;index=3">Japanese From Zero</a> series has sometimes gotten flak for having to look up kanji, or not having read a lot of novels in Japanese as being somewhat not qualified enough. However, there are a lot of videos of George having fun with Japanese locals and friends, whereas the pitch-perfect millennials keep talking about Japanese from their bedrooms and seem somewhat anti-social or unlikable. Let&rsquo;s say I know who I&rsquo;d rather hang out with.</p>

<p> The problem here is that someone who is very good at Japanese is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually pretty good at putting things into perspective. How I choose to spend my time is very different from when I was in my 20s, and even though I could technically make more time, priorities of how I want to spend my time have shifted over the years. However, these all-or-nothing videos did get to me. Whatever progress I make, I feel like it&rsquo;s extremely slow compared to other people. This is what makes the community a double-edged sword - the same community which also gives me great motivation, such as Livakivi, my favorite content creator when it comes to learning Japanese who shares a much more relatable story.</p>

<p>Long story short, what&rsquo;s bothering me is not my own progress, but the comparison to others. Comparassion is the quickest way to suck the joy out of any activity and it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m rarely on social media.</p>
