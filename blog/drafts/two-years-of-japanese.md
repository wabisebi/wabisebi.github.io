The Wild Web of Language Learning Gurus

My day usually starts out with reviews of vocabulary flashcards in a spaced-repetition application called Anki, which also happens to display a heatmap of days studied. This morning I noticed that it's been exactly two years since I started studying Japanese. The two-year mark is giving me mixed feelings, with slight disappointment seeming to win the battle. I spend some time this morning reflecting on why I feel this.

#### The Japanese Self-Study Community-- a double-edged sword

The Japanese self-study community on YouTube and Reddit is a peculiar one, marked by heated debates about the most efficient language learning methods. Some of its most prominent content creators are twenty-somethings who project unwavering confidence in their approaches, often competing to showcase their perfect pitch accent while boasting about how quickly they achieved fluency.

The core message of these 'gurus' seems universal: If you really want to become fluent in Japanese, you can do it in an extremely short time span by just immersing for a large number of hours each day, an idea popularized by the [AJATT method](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Some go as far as saying you should live 24/7 in Japanese, disregarding your social life. Do anything else and it's a waste of time. (One popular creator even stating that if you can't do two hours a day you should just quit Japanese altogether.) Throw in the dubious claim that learning in the wrong order will permanently harm your fluency, and you have a recipe to make new learners confused and worried about where to start.

What I rarely hear these creators talk about are building meaningful connections through language or learning more about another culture. It seems the focus is on being good in Japanese

 George Trombley, the well-known creator of the [Japanese From Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsrakMT1h2g&list=PLOcym2c7xnBy_L5_iQzgSrzMIXH7DUwB0&index=3) series has sometimes gotten flak for having to look up kanji, or not having read a lot of novels in Japanese as being somewhat not qualified enough. However, there are a lot of videos of George having fun with Japanese locals and friends, whereas the pitch-perfect millennials keep talking about Japanese from their bedrooms and seem somewhat anti-social or unlikable. Let's say I know who I'd rather hang out with. 
 
 The problem here is that someone who is very good at Japanese is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students. 

I'm usually pretty good at putting things into perspective. How I choose to spend my time is very different from when I was in my 20s, and even though I could technically make more time, priorities of how I want to spend my time have shifted over the years. However, these all-or-nothing videos did get to me. Whatever progress I make, I feel like it's extremely slow compared to other people. This is what makes the community a double-edged sword - the same community which also gives me great motivation, such as Livakivi, my favorite content creator when it comes to learning Japanese who shares a much more relatable story.

Long story short, what's bothering me is not my own progress, but the comparison to others. Comparassion is the quickest way to suck the joy out of any activity and it's why I'm rarely on social media.
