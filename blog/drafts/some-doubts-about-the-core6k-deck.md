Learning 6K Vocabulary in a better context

One discrepancy with my Japanese studies at the moment is that I have spent the last two years learning around 4,500 vocabulary words that I can read, yet can't hold a basic conversation in Japanese. Although this was a conscious decision when studying, focusing more on understanding and reading instead of producing sentences, I feel somewhat worried about not being able to hold even very basic conversations, and I will be moving to Japan in two weeks.

Today I spent some time looking up basic conversations in Japanese and found this very helpful YouTube channel with great content.
