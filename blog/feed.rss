I Made My First YouTube Video
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>During my visit to Japan last June, I worked on my first little film project, creating a fully edited and color-graded travel video. I used a DJI Osmo Pocket 3—a cute little film camera with a built-in stabilizer—along with some ND filters to help shoot in bright daylight. Over the course of two weeks, I captured scenes during my long walks through Tokyo.</p>

<p>After a ton of YouTube tutorials on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, this is the final result. The music is by one of my favorite Japanese musicians, Tomoyuki Asakawa.</p>

How I Learned Hiragana and Katakana
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>The Japanese written language is a fusion of three distinct scripts. Typically, children in Japan first learn Hiragana and Katakana, collectively called &lsquo;the kana,&rsquo; before progressing to the more complex and vast set of Kanji characters imported from China. This is also the order of learning that is generally recommended for foreigners like me.</p>

<h4>Phonetics</h4>

<p>The kana are phonetic scripts, meaning they visually represent sounds used in speech and don&rsquo;t carry any meaning. Both character sets share the same syllables but serve different purposes within the language. Although not used this way in practice, you could technically spell all Japanese words using just these two scripts.</p>

<h4>Memorizing Characters Using Mnemonics</h4>

<p>I found memorizing Hiragana and Katakana fairly easy, and it took me about a week. What worked best was utilizing <strong>visual mnemonics</strong> that simplify remembering information through simple associations.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for memorizing the character &lsquo;の.&rsquo; This character represents a syllable roughly pronounced as &lsquo;no&rsquo; in the English word &lsquo;not&rsquo;. Associating it with a &lsquo;No/not smoking&rsquo; sign, which is similar in shape to the hiragana character, was a helpful visual cue.</p>

<p><img src="./img/ws_kana_no_smoking.webp" alt="kana-no-sign" /></p>

<p>The internet is full of examples of mnemonics for the kana, so there is no need to make them up yourself.</p>

<h4>Learning How to Write</h4>

<p>Learning to write Hiragana and Katakana isn&rsquo;t too challenging, but it&rsquo;s important to follow the correct stroke order. Correct stroke order is crucial because it helps you intuitively write new characters and improves readability.</p>

<p>I started with some practice sheets to learn the stroke order, and then switched to a gridded notebook, writing the characters from memory.</p>

<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>

<p>During my first month in Japan back in 2020, I regularly did speed quizzes to recognize kana as quickly as possible. Pretty soon, the characters came naturally, and eventually, I didn&rsquo;t have to rely on mnemonics. Reading Hiragana and Katakana now feels as familiar as reading the Latin script; I simply know their shapes and sounds without having to think about them.</p>

<h4>Practical Use in Daily Life</h4>

<p>Hiragana is mostly used for Japanese-origin words, so without knowing the meanings of those words, it wasn&rsquo;t very useful to me until I started learning some actual vocabulary.</p>

<p>The most useful thing for me right from the start was knowing Katakana. This script is primarily used for foreign loanwords, often imported from English, making them easy to understand. For instance, when I was searching for shampoo at a convenience store, I picked up a bottle with the text &lsquo;シャンプー&rsquo; on it. These syllables spell &lsquo;sha-n-puu,&rsquo; making it likely I had found the right product. Although only a small step, it started making things easier for me and marked my beginning of learning Japanese vocabulary.</p>

It Doesn&rsquo;t Count if You Don&rsquo;t Share it
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>In my previous post, I talked about my bad habit of not finishing self-initiated projects. A frustrating side-effect of this is that I will inevitably see another person executing a very similar idea, sharing it publicly and receiving positive feedback. Now it feels like I&rsquo;ve missed my window and ever launching it would seem derivative. These are usually illustrations or art projects which are very close to something I have been working on for a long time but never felt like it was ready to share.</p>

<p>I recently came across a passage that helped me realize that I have only myself to blame for feeling upset when this happens.</p>

<p>In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a>, music producer Rick Rubin shares what I find to be a beautiful perspective on <em>ideas</em>. I think of his view as seeing ideas almost like independent entities floating in the universe, waiting to be found and brought to life.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you have an idea you&rsquo;re excited about and you don&rsquo;t bring it to life, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for the idea to find its voice through another maker. This isn&rsquo;t because the other artist stole your idea, but because the idea&rsquo;s time has come.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Author and marketer <a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a> states it less poetically in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53479927-the-practice?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=KNybrLUG3u&amp;rank=1">The Practice: Shipping Creative Work</a> and cuts straight to the point when explaining the importance of <em>shipping</em> your idea or product out into the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shipping, because it doesn&rsquo;t count if you don&rsquo;t share it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not to say that we can&rsquo;t make things purely for ourselves, which definitely counts in its own way. But if we want feedback and a relationship with others through our work, it will only happen if we actually put it out there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try and share things in a state where they might not yet feel &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; (whatever that means), rather than waiting too long and losing the moment. It might not ever be a masterpiece, but at least it now counts.

Clean Slate
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>In 2001, I coded my first website, all about Spider-Man comics. I built it in HTML, complete with iframes and speech bubble drawings for the navigation. More sites followed: a Harry Potter fan site and a site celebrating the newly-launched Xbox to name a few.</p>

<p>Each project was abandoned as quickly as it was conceived. Once the novelty wore off, I&rsquo;d jump to the next thing, leaving behind a wasteland of iframes and half-written introductions.</p>

<p>This pattern of jumping from project to project has followed me throughout my life.</p>

<p>Two years ago, I started working on <em>Wabisebi</em>, a blog about Japan. Soon came additional ideas: book reviews, artist spotlights, and a language study section. I hired developers, kept adding features, and talked up this great project I was building. But like always, the novelty wore off and perfectionism kicked in. The thought of filling and illustrating the entire blog became overwhelming.</p>

<p>Recently I spent a lot of time reflecting on this recurring problem and decided to try out a change. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good to do the <em>reverse</em> of what has not been working.</p>

<p>So, instead of building a website with tons of features that I then need to fill up, I&rsquo;ve decided to start bottom-up. Starting at its most basic fundamentals and only implementing things when they are <em>really</em> needed. I&rsquo;m using this simple <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashlog script</a>, which converts markdown text into HTML pages and let&rsquo;s me post straight from the command line. Sometimes the best way forward is to strip everything back to its essentials and just begin.</p>
