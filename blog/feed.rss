Sentence Mining Spam Messages
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>A few days ago, I signed up for the JRE Card, which is a point card linked to my Suica travel card. Basically, I can earn points at most shops around the station by purchasing things like coffee. These points can then be used for travel discounts.</p>

<p><img src="./img/2025_07_10_jre.jpg" alt="JRE_Spam" />
This spam message is perfect for sentence mining—it contains only one (compound) word I didn’t know yet: 新着情報.</p>

<p><img src="./img/2025_07_10_lookup.jpg" alt="JRE_Spam" /><em>I use the app Shirabe Jisho on my iPhone to quickly look up words—either by taking a photo of the text, copying and pasting it into the app, or drawing the kanji directly.</em></p>

<p>It turns out these are two separate words (&ldquo;newly&rdquo; and &ldquo;information&rdquo;), but when used together as a compound, they mean something like “what’s new.” It’s commonly used on news websites and in apps.</p>

<p>Finally, I create an Anki card that includes the sentence, target word, and additional details like audio for both the sentence and the word. While it&rsquo;s possible to do this directly in Anki, I’ve found that Migaku’s card creator works great—it automatically generates the audio files.</p>

<p><img src="./img/2025_07_10_migaku.png" alt="img_migaku" /></p>

<p>With a click of a button, the card is created and sent to Anki, where it becomes part of my learning routine.</p>

Coffee Confusion at Tully&rsquo;s
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><img src="./img/ws_tully_kohi.jpg" alt="tully_coffee_sign" /></p>

<p>This morning, I decided to get regular coffee instead of my usual café latte at Tully’s. I was already a bit thrown off to learn that what they call “drip coffee” is just regular coffee that comes out of a machine—not hand-poured or anything fancy. But what really confused me was the Japanese menu, where “drip coffee” was labeled as 日本のコーヒー, which literally means “Japanese coffee.”</p>

<p>Not sure how to order, I tried saying “drippu kōhī” (ドリップコーヒー), and that worked just fine, so it seems like that’s the standard term.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I looked up where this “Japanese coffee” label might come. Even ChatGPT doesn’t seem entirely sure why drip coffee was labeled that way in this case.</p>

<p><img src="./img/ws_chatgpt_dripcoffee.png" alt="chatgpt_explanation" /></p>

<p><strong>! UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>As I was talking about this with my wife later today, she pointed out that the kanji 本日 in this case is read as honjitsu, meaning “today.” So 本日のコーヒー means “today’s coffee,” referring to the specific beans being used that day.</p>

<p>Since 本日 can also be read as Nihon (“Japan”), I had initially interpreted it as “Japanese coffee,” but honjitsu makes much more sense in this context. That said, it would still feel a bit odd to order “today’s coffee,” so you’d probably just say “hot coffee” or “drippu kōhī” (ドリップコーヒー) when ordering.</p>

Sentence Mining Within the Core 6K Deck
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I’ve worked through about two-thirds of the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1880390099">Core 6k Anki deck</a> so far. At some point, I got bored with it and shifted to sentence mining—mainly picking out new words from content I actually enjoy, like shows, articles, or YouTube videos.</p>

<p>But every now and then, especially while reading the <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/">NHK Easy website</a>, I come across words that turn out to be from the unseen part of the Core 6k deck. Even though I haven’t officially studied those cards yet, I end up mining them naturally through immersion.</p>

<p>It’s a good reminder that sentence mining isn’t just for completely new words outside the deck. It can also overlap with words I would have eventually reached in Core6k—just in a way that feels much more alive and relevant.</p>

Realizing I Need Grammar
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Not knowing much grammar is becoming a real problem—something I’ve been really noticing now that I’ve moved to Japan. I had hoped to pick it up naturally through immersion, but since I’ve spent most of my time reviewing and adding new vocabulary and kanji readings, I feel like I’m missing the glue that holds everything together. It’s frustrating that I can’t form meaningful sentences when talking to people I meet. Even though I know a large number of isolated words, I still struggle to put them together in a way that makes sense. Just the other day, I met the owner of the izakaya next door, and when he started asking me questions about just moving here, I broke out in a sweat—I couldn’t find a way to respond beyond a few awkward words and gestures. In a way, when it comes to actual communication, I don’t feel much more advanced than I was two years ago.</p>

Japanese with Tanaka-san and Creating New Flashcards for Familiar Vocabulary
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><img src="./img/tanaka-san-japanese.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been sentence mining some new vocabulary words today from the beginner-friendly YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@japanese_tanakasan">Learn Japanese with Tanaka san</a> and wanted to share it here as I think it&rsquo;s a good channel. Right now I have about 80-90% word comprehension on most videos, which works well since I understand most of what is being said but am still picking up some new, high-frequency words.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found useful is that I&rsquo;m also encountering words I already know from my Anki deck, but seeing them used in natural contexts and different sentence patterns. It&rsquo;s been helpful for reinforcing my understanding and picking up more nuanced usage that I might have missed when just learning the isolated vocabulary. It&rsquo;s one thing to know a word&rsquo;s definition, but seeing how it actually works in conversation makes a difference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been creating new flashcards for these already known words with the sentences from the videos, and now I&rsquo;m wondering if I should delete the original cards from my core 6k deck since the new context-based ones seem more useful.</p>

A Familiar Place in &ldquo;Japan Sinks: 2020&rdquo;
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Yesterday I started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12031040/">Japan Sinks: 2020</a>, a mini-series based on the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Sinks">Japan Sinks</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakyo_Komatsu">Sakyo Komatsu</a>. To be honest, the first episode was a real bummer for someone who is planning a move to Japan. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see some familiar buildings and locations in the opening scenes. Last June, <a href="./i-made-my-first-youtube-video.html">I filmed my first video</a>, and one of its locations - which I accidentally stumbled upon during my walks - was Komazawa Olympic Park.</p>

<h4>Komazawa Olympic Park Control Tower</h4>

<p>When I arrived at the park, I was immediately drawn to the Komazawa Olympic Park Control Tower. I&rsquo;d never heard of it before but later found out that it was designed by the celebrated architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Ashihara">Yoshinobu Ashihara</a> for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.  Its structure refers to traditional Japanese wood architecture, but it&rsquo;s executed in a unique, concrete modernist style. Because it&rsquo;s so tall, it&rsquo;s the only shot I made during my trip where I panned the camera vertically. For the final video, I used a static shot of the bottom part since all the other shots were static. However, in the still from the anime, you can see the structure in its entirety.</p>

<img src="./img/japan-sinks-02v2.webp" alt="japan-sinks-shot02" /><em>Still from Japan Sinks: 2020, (S1.E1 The Beginning of the End)</em></p>

<h4>Olympic Park Stadium and Basketball Court</h4>

<p>Adjacent to the Control Tower stands the Komazawa Olympic Park Stadium, also from 1964 but designed by Masachika Murata. Nowadays it&rsquo;s used as a multi-purpose stadium, mostly for football and rugby matches. This location plays an important part in the first episode of Japan Sinks. If you walk down the steps behind the stadium, you will get to the basketball court. You can see the orange basket in the bottom right corner of the anime screengrab—the same orange basket which I shot while extending my arm through the railing from above.

<img src="./img/ws_video_01v2.webp" alt="wb_location1" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only seen the first episode so far but I am enjoying the show, even if it&rsquo;s just for looking out for places I recognize.</p>

The Wild Web of Language Learning Gurus
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Today marks exactly two years since I started studying Japanese, and although I have made considerable progress, I&rsquo;m feeling somewhat disappointed with my current level. I&rsquo;ve spent some time reflecting on where I think this feeling comes from.</p>

<h4>The Japanese Self-Study Community – A Double-Edged Sword</h4>

<p>For the past two years, I have been self-studying Japanese. I prefer learning skills at my own pace rather than joining traditional classes; however, I do find it motivating to hear about other people&rsquo;s experiences and to adjust my own systems when I come across good advice. In fact, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Livakivi">Livakivi&rsquo;s</a> video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpfCWogjnwc&amp;t=788s">I Learned Japanese 1 Hour a Day for 600 Days Straight</a> that motivated me to set study goals and provided me with a sort of blueprint. Most of my process up until now has been based on Livakivi&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p>While the Japanese language learning community on YouTube provides me with inspiring content, it&rsquo;s also marked by heated debates about learning methods. Some of its prominent content creators project unwavering confidence, competing to showcase perfect pitch accent while boasting about their relatively rapid path to fluency. The core message: achieve Japanese fluency quickly through intensive immersion—an idea popularized by the <a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AJATT method</a>. Some advocate living entirely in Japanese (AJATT stands for All Japanese All The Time), abandoning your English-speaking friends and sleeping with Japanese audio playing in the background, a pseudoscience coined &lsquo;passive immersion&rsquo;. They dismiss other approaches as wasteful, including traditional textbooks, with one popular creator claiming that studying less than two hours daily means you should quit altogether.</p>

<p>The problem is that someone who has become very skilled at something is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students about that thing, and while mastery can build self-confidence, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations when teaching others or develop into a downright arrogant attitude. Some of this might have to do with the cognitive bias called &ldquo;the expert blind spot,&rdquo; which occurs when someone who has mastered a skill loses sight of what it&rsquo;s like to be a beginner, or maybe it&rsquo;s just the fact that some content creators also have a &lsquo;unique&rsquo; course to sell you.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, a recurring part of the narrative seems to be this &ldquo;no pain, no gain&rdquo; rhetoric which is so pervasive online nowadays. People often showcase their intense dedication and long hours as the only path to success, implying that those who can&rsquo;t match this intensity somehow lack commitment. This overlooks the reality that people live different lives with varying circumstances, and the time someone can devote to learning doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect their passion or desire to improve.</p>

<p>And that gets to the heart of my issue this morning—not my progress, but the comparison to others is what is making me feel unhappy. It&rsquo;s learning 4,000 vocabulary words in two years and then seeing someone on Reddit who claims they learned 1,700 in just two weeks. Comparing ourselves to others is the quickest way to suck the joy out of anything we&rsquo;re doing. That&rsquo;s precisely why I spend very little time on social media these days. Even though I&rsquo;m well aware of the pitfalls of comparison, I still let it get to me when it comes to language learning.</p>

<p>And so, I want to end on a positive note as well as a reminder to myself: What matters most is that I&rsquo;ve improved consistently over these past two years, studying daily without giving up and building a consistent habit. I may not have aced the N1 proficiency test in eight months or shocked any natives with my perfect Japanese pitch accent, but I&rsquo;m advancing at my own pace and enjoying the moments when I am able to do new things.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9n66Aap13o">Matsuoka Shuzo</a>, Japan&rsquo;s most positive man, would say: 諦めんなよ！Never give up!</p>

Fried Eggs and Japanese Super Immersion
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Two great things happened to me today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I learned the Japanese word for &lsquo;fried eggs,&rsquo; which I surprisingly never came across nor ever used in Japan, even though I love eating them. Maybe it&rsquo;s due to my heavy addiction to convenience store bought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RelaC9GBwMs">tamago-sando</a>, which uses chopped up boiled eggs mixed with mayonnaise.</p></li>
<li><p>Fried eggs are what Toriyama-san had for breakfast this morning. That in itself is not great for me per se; however, it comes from a video created by the guys behind a channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JSI55">Japanese Super Immersion</a>, which was recommended to me this morning and I have been really enjoying.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Finding Entertaining and Beginner-friendly Content</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a hard time finding beginner level Japanese immersion content which is educational yet entertaining to watch. I easily get bored by the generic topics discussed on most language learning channels and when I find content that aligns with my interests its usually to difficult for me to enjoy.</p>

<p>What makes the conversations between Toriyama-san and Miyazaki-san entertaining to watch for me is that they are similar to my own friends, not taking themselves too seriously and joking while having a conversation. I feel like I could easily hang out with them in real life, which also makes me genuinely interested in what they have to say, and that seems to be the part I was missing so far with other channels.</p>

I Made My First YouTube Video
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Last June I worked on my first video project while visiting Tokyo. I used a DJI Osmo Pocket 3—a small, cute-looking film camera which stabilizes itself during filming. Over the course of two weeks, I captured scenes during my walks through the vast metropolis of Tokyo as well as some lovely day trips with my partner.</p>

<p>After a ton of YouTube tutorials on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, this is the final result. The music is by one of my favorite Japanese musicians, Tomoyuki Asakawa and proved very helpful for making selection of shots.</p>
