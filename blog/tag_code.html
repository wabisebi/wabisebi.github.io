<p>In 2001, I learned to code my first websiteâ€”a site all about Spider-Man comics, something I was into collecting at the time. It was built in HTML, using iframes and everything. Then came a Harry Potter fan site with a custom cursor in the shape of a wand, followed a year later by a website celebrating the then newly launched Xbox.
