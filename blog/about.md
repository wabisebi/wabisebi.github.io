About

Hi, I’m Seb. This blog is a casual log of my day-to-day experience learning Japanese—what I’m working on, how I’m approaching it, and what I’m figuring out along the way.

It’s not a study guide, and I’m definitely not claiming to have the most efficient methods. I’m just trying to enjoy the process, stay motivated, and avoid burning out.

There’s a lot of pressure in the self-study world to be fast, efficient, or always doing the “right” thing. That pressure hasn’t helped me much—in fact, it’s made things harder at times. So if you’re here, I hope you just enjoy following along, maybe find something useful, and most of all, feel okay doing things your own way.
