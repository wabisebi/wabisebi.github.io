About

Hi, I’m Seb. This blog is where I document my day-to-day experience of learning Japanese—what I’m studying, how I’m studying it, and what I’m figuring out along the way.

It’s not a guide or a blueprint. I’m probably not doing things the most efficient way—and that’s okay. I’m just trying to keep it fun and avoid burning out.

The self-study world can sometimes feel like a competition, with people showing off how fast or perfectly they’re learning. That mindset hasn’t helped me much. If you’re reading along, I hope you enjoy it and maybe pick up a tip or two—but mostly, I hope it reminds you that it’s okay to go at your own pace.
