<p>Whether it&rsquo;s figuring out how to fix a broken faucet, learning code, or watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DHOVziRwBA">let&rsquo;s play videos in Japanese</a>, YouTube is the place where I consume most of my daily content. My ADD brain thrives on receiving information via moving images, sounds, and animations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been curious about the process of making a video from start to finish but never had an idea what I could make a video about. My life is too mundane for vlogs, and the illustrations I work on usually fall under non-disclosure agreements, making it hard to share the entire process in a video.</p>

<p>During my last visit to Japan in June, I decided to do a little filming project, making a fully edited and color-graded travel video, and <a href="./sharing-counts.html">against all expectations</a>, I actually finished it. I ended up buying a DJI Osmo Pocket 3, a cute little film camera with built-in stabilizer, together with some ND filters that help shoot in bright daylight. Over the course of two weeks, I shot scenes during my long walks and travels through Tokyo.</p>

<p>Upon coming home, I decided on the editing software DaVinci Resolve, watched a ton of YouTube videos on editing, color-grading, and audio mixing, and made this little video.</p>

<p>In 2001, I coded my first website, all about Spider-Man comics. I built it in HTML, complete with iframes and speech bubble drawings for the navigation. More sites followed: a Harry Potter fan site and a site celebrating the newly-launched Xbox to name a few.</p>

<p>Each project was abandoned as quickly as it was conceived. Once the novelty wore off, I&rsquo;d jump to the next thing, leaving behind a wasteland of iframes and half-written introductions.</p>

<p>This pattern of jumping from project to project has followed me throughout my life.</p>

<p>Two years ago, I started working on <em>Wabisebi</em>, a blog about Japan. Soon came additional ideas: book reviews, artist spotlights, and a language study section. I hired developers, kept adding features, and talked up this great project I was building. But like always, the novelty wore off and perfectionism kicked in. The thought of filling and illustrating the entire blog became overwhelming.</p>

<p>Recently I spent a lot of time reflecting on this recurring problem and decided to try out a change. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good to do the <em>reverse</em> of what has not been working.</p>

<p>So, instead of building a website with tons of features that I then need to fill up, I&rsquo;ve decided to start bottom-up. Starting at its most basic fundamentals and only implementing things when they are <em>really</em> needed. I&rsquo;m using this simple <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashlog script</a>, which converts markdown text into HTML pages and let&rsquo;s me post straight from the command line. Sometimes the best way forward is to strip everything back to its essentials and just begin.</p>
