It Doesn't Count if You Don't Share it

In my previous post, I talked about the bad habit of not finishing projects and always jumping to a next, more novel one. A frustrating side-effect of this is that we will sometimes see another person executing a very similar idea, sharing it online and receiving positive feedback. In my case, these are usually illustrations or art projects which are very close to something I have been working on for a long time. 

I recently came across two passages that have helped me realize that I have only myself to blame for feeling upset when this happens. 

In his book [The Creative Act: A Way of Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act) music producer Rick Rubin shares a beautiful way of thinking about ideas, almost like independent entities floating around in the universe that want to be found. It's flipping the narrative, making ideas the important thing and our personal struggles or ego secondary.

>"If you have an idea you're excited about and you don't bring it to life, it's not uncommon for the idea to find its voice through another maker. This isn't because the other artist stole your idea, but because the idea's time has come."

Author and marketer [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) states it less poetically and cuts straight to the point when explaining the importance of *shipping* your idea or product out into the world in his book [The Practice: Shipping Creative Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53479927-the-practice?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KNybrLUG3u&rank=1)

>"Shipping, because it doesn't count if you don't share it."

Of course that's not to say that we can't make things purely out of joy for ourselves, which definitely counts in its own way. But if we want feedback and a relationship with others through our work, it will only happen if we actually put it out there.

I've decided to try and share things in a state where they might not yet feel 'perfect' (whatever that means), rather than waiting too long and losing interest or missing the moment. It might not ever be a masterpiece, but at least it now counts.
