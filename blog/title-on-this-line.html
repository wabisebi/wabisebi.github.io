<p>Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic scripts, meaning they visually represent sounds used in speech and don&rsquo;t carry any inherent meaning. Both character sets share the same syllables but serve different purposes within the written language. Although not typical for Japanese natives, you could technically spell all Japanese words using these two scripts.</p>

<h4>Memorizing Characters Using Mnemonics</h4>

<p>I found memorizing Hiragana and Katakana fairly easy, and it took me about a week. What seemed to work best was utilizing <strong>visual</strong> <strong>mnemonics</strong>—memory aids or tricks that simplify remembering information through simple associations.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for memorizing the character &lsquo;の.&rsquo; This character represents a syllable roughly pronounced as &lsquo;NO&rsquo; in English. Associating it with a &lsquo;NO smoking&rsquo; sign, which is similar in shape to the hiraganacharacter, is a helpful visual cue.</p>

<p>A simple Google search will give a lot of examples of mnemonics for Hiragana and Katakana. However, coming up with your own can be fun and possibly easier to remember.</p>

<h4>Learning How to Writessss</h4>

<p>Learning to write Hiragana and Katakana isn&rsquo;t too challenging, but it&rsquo;s important to follow the correct stroke order. Correct stroke order is crucial because it helps you intuitively write new characters and improves readability. I highly recommend paying attention to the stroke order from the beginning to avoid developing bad habits that are difficult to correct later.</p>

<p>I started with practice sheets to learn the stroke order, and then switched to a gridded notebook, writing the characters from memory.</p>

<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>

<p>During my first month in Japan back in 2020, I regularly did speed quizzes to recognize kana as quickly as possible. Pretty soon, the characters came naturally, and eventually, I didn&rsquo;t have to rely on mnemonics. Reading Hiragana and Katakana now feels as familiar as reading the Latin script; I simply know their shapes and sounds without having to think about them. yes</p>

<h4>Practical Use in Daily Life</h4>

<p>Hiragana is mostly used for Japanese-origin words, so without knowing the meanings of those words, it wasn&rsquo;t very useful to me until I started learning some actual vocabulary.</p>

<p>The most useful thing for me right from the start was knowing Katakana. This script is primarily used for foreign loanwords, often imported from English, making them easy to understand. For instance, when I was searching for shampoo at a convenience store, I picked up a bottle with the text &lsquo;シャンプー&rsquo; on it. These syllables spell &lsquo;sha-n-puu,&rsquo; making it likely I had found the right product. Although only a small step, it started making things easier for me.</p>
