<p>This morning marks exactly two years since I started studying Japanese. While I&rsquo;ve made considerable progress, I&rsquo;m feeling mixed emotions, with slight disappointment seeming to have the upper hand. I&rsquo;ve spent time this morning reflecting on why this is and where these feelings come from.</p>

<h4>The Japanese Self-Study Community – A Double-Edged Sword</h4>

<p>The Japanese self-study community on YouTube and Reddit is a peculiar one. While often inspiring, it&rsquo;s marked by heated debates about learning methods and personal dramas between community figures. Many prominent content creators are twenty-somethings who project unwavering confidence, competing to showcase perfect pitch accent while boasting about their rapid path to fluency.</p>

<p>Their core message is consistent: achieve Japanese fluency quickly through intensive immersion—an idea popularized by the <a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AJATT method</a>. Some advocate living entirely in Japanese, disregarding your English-speaking friends and even sleeping with Japanese audio playing. They dismiss other approaches as wasteful, with one popular creator claiming that studying less than two hours daily means you should quit altogether.</p>

<p>The problem here is that someone who is skilled at something is not necessarily good at teaching or inspiring new students about that skill. Speaking from experience, we sometimes pour vast amounts of time into skills to compensate for other areas of life. While mastery can build confidence, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations when teaching others or develop into an arrogant attitude.</p>

<p>And that gets to the heart of the issue—not my progress, but the comparison to others. Comparison is the quickest way to drain joy from any pursuit, which is why I generally avoid social media. People all live their lives differently, choosing where to put their time, and we all have areas where we know we&rsquo;re not spending enough time.</p>

<p>And so, to end on a positive note: What matters most is that I&rsquo;ve improved consistently over these two years, studying daily without giving up. I may not have aced the N1 proficiency test in eight months or shocked any natives with my perfect Japanese, but I&rsquo;m advancing at my own pace.</p>

<p>As Matsuoka Shuzo would say: 諦めんだよ！</p>

How I Learned Hiragana and Katakana
</a></h3>

<p>The Japanese written language is a fusion of three distinct scripts. Children in Japan first learn Hiragana and Katakana, before progressing to the more complex and vast set of Kanji characters, which were imported from China around the 5th century CE.</p>

<h4>Phonetics</h4>

<p>Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic scripts, meaning they visually represent sounds used in speech and don&rsquo;t carry any meaning. Both character sets share the same syllables but serve different purposes within the language. Although not used this way in practice, you could technically spell all Japanese words using just these two scripts.</p>

<h4>Memorizing Characters Using Mnemonics</h4>

<p>I found memorizing Hiragana and Katakana fairly easy, and it took me about a week. What worked best was utilizing <strong>visual mnemonics</strong> that simplify remembering information through simple associations.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for memorizing the character &lsquo;の.&rsquo; This character represents a syllable roughly pronounced as &lsquo;no&rsquo; in the English word &lsquo;not&rsquo;. Associating it with a &lsquo;No/not smoking&rsquo; sign, which is similar in shape to the hiragana character, was a helpful visual cue.</p>

<p>The internet is full of examples of mnemonics for the kana, so there is no need to make them up yourself.</p>

<h4>Learning How to Write</h4>

<p>Learning to write Hiragana and Katakana isn&rsquo;t too challenging, but it&rsquo;s important to follow the correct stroke order. Correct stroke order is crucial because it helps you intuitively write new characters and improves readability.</p>

<p>I started with some practice sheets to learn the stroke order, and then switched to a gridded notebook, writing the characters from memory.</p>

<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>

<p>During my first month in Japan back in 2020, I regularly did speed quizzes to recognize kana as quickly as possible. Pretty soon, the characters came naturally, and eventually, I didn&rsquo;t have to rely on mnemonics. Reading Hiragana and Katakana now feels as familiar as reading the Latin script; I simply know their shapes and sounds without having to think about them.</p>

<h4>Practical Use in Daily Life</h4>

<p>Hiragana is mostly used for Japanese-origin words, so without knowing the meanings of those words, it wasn&rsquo;t very useful to me until I started learning some actual vocabulary.</p>

<p>The most useful thing for me right from the start was knowing Katakana. This script is primarily used for foreign loanwords, often imported from English, making them easy to understand. For instance, when I was searching for shampoo at a convenience store, I picked up a bottle with the text &lsquo;シャンプー&rsquo; on it. These syllables spell &lsquo;sha-n-puu,&rsquo; making it likely I had found the right product. Although only a small step, it started making things easier for me and marked my beginning of learning Japanese vocabulary.</p>
