Clean Slate

Two years ago, I started working on a website called Wabisebi. It began as an idea to blog about my interest in Japan. Then came additional ideas: book reviews, artist spotlights, and a language study section. And then, as with most of my projects, the novelty wore off, and perfectionism and overwhelm kicked in. The thought of having to fill the entire blog and illustrate everything started to feel like an obligation.

A few things happened recently that made me think I should do things differently if I want to actually produce something meaningful. I'll write about these events in a future post, as I don't want these posts to be too long.

Suffice to say, sometimes it's good to do the reverse of what hasn't been working. So, instead of building a website with tons of features that I then need to fill up, I've decided to start bottom-up: starting with its most basic fundamentals and only implementing things when they are really needed.

And so, I took a crash course refresher on HTML and CSS and implemented this great little [bashlog script](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog), making it possible to post from the command line. Like the early internet, it's basic and there are no excuses not to publish anything.

Instead of worrying what this website should be about, I will just write. The content will shape the site. Maybe it's entertaining for you, the reader, or maybe you the reader will never visit. I'll let it go for now and just start with this clean slate.
